#These results can be explained a few ways. First, recent technological advancements have made technology more energy efficient.
#As the tech evolves, more consumers are spending money on these products while we see emissions lower simultaneously.
#Second, there may have been a decline in jobs in the manufacturing field and other field related to emissions. At the same time,
#there has been a consistent increase in service-based jobs, leading to an increase in spending on services. Lastly, environmental friendly
#products have consistently been pushed over the past few years, possibly leading to a change in consumer preference, spending more money on
#products that are more environmentally friendly.

#Limitations to this exploratory analysis would include the small sample size (df=17) as well as outside factors that could obviously be affecting either of these variables.
