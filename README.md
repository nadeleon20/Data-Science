Hello and welcome to my repository. My name is Nicholas De Leon and I am an Intermediate Data Scientist, currently working on DoD contracts. 

This repository serves the purpose of displaying my capabilities as a Data Scientist while also allowing me to practice new skills and solve data-related problems that I am interested in. 
Currently within this repository, I have completed some exploratory analysis on the correlations between various factors that can be found in the Federeal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).
After finding a strong correlation between Personal Spending in Virginia and Total Emissions in Virginia, I created line graphs to show the evolution of both as well as possible explanations for this relationship.

A passion of mine is finance which led me to begin another project within this repository. I have created a model using the scikit-learn package in Python that will take 8 different quantitative variables and predict whether these applications are approved for a loan.
After creating this model, I created a confusion matrix and calculated the True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate of the model's predictions. Although my model is not as accurate as I would like (Accuracy = 72%), I am planning to create an ROC curve for this model.

After completing the analysis of my model, I plan to find data on which to use clustering to benefit a marketing department.
