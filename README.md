Hello and welcome to my repository. My name is Nicholas De Leon and I am an Intermediate Data Scientist, currently working on DoD contracts. 

This repository serves the purpose of displaying my capabilities as a Data Scientist while also allowing me to practice new skills and solve data-related problems that I am interested in. 
Currently within this repository, I have completed some exploratory analysis on the correlations between various factors that can be found in the Federeal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).
After finding a strong correlation between Personal Spending in Virginia and Total Emissions in Virginia, I created line graphs to show the evolution of both as well as possible explanations for this relationship.

A passion of mine is finance which led me to begin another project within this repository. I have created a model using the scikit-learn package in Python that will take 8 different quantitative variables and predict whether these applications are approved for a loan.
After creating this model, I created a confusion matrix and calculated the True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate of the model's predictions. Although my model is not as accurate as I would like (Accuracy = 82%), my ROC curve displays an AUC of .802 which is not terrible. Additionally, I created a cluster graph in an attempt to identify an ideal audience for a loan provider to advertise to. Unfortunately, the clusters that were created are not as helpful as I would have liked.

My next project will be creating an object recognition model in TensorFlow that can differentiate between specific fruits and vegetables within images.
